# In this example, we have THREE calculators, the two included in the previous
# exercises as well as Whiz Bang Calculator that can even calculate the hypotenuse
# of a triangle if given the length of the other two sides. Figure out how to 
# DRY up all the code below - there shouldn't be a single method duplicated between
# any two classes.

class SimpleCalculator

  def add(first_number, second_number)
    first_number + second_number
  end

  def subtract(first_number, second_number)
    first_number - second_number
  end

  def multiply(first_number, second_number)
    first_number * second_number
  end

  def divide(first_number, second_number)
    first_number / second_number
  end

end

class FancyCalculator < SimpleCalculator

  def square_root(number)
    Math.sqrt(number)
  end

end

class WhizBangCalculator < SimpleCalculator

  def hypotenuse(first_number, second_number)
    Math.hypot(first_number, second_number)
  end
  
  def exponent(first_number, exponent_number)
    total = 1
    exponent_number.times { total = multiply(total,first_number) }
    total
  end

end

# Copy your driver code from the previous exercise and more below:

adding = FancyCalculator.new.add(1, 2)
p adding

sqr = FancyCalculator.new.square_root(4)
p sqr

dividing = FancyCalculator.new.divide(8, 2)
p dividing

hypotenuse_test = WhizBangCalculator.new.hypotenuse(22, 17)
p hypotenuse_test

sanity_check = WhizBangCalculator.new.add(1, 1)
p sanity_check
